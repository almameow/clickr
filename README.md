Technologies Used: Full MEAN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, AngularJS, Node.js), iOS in Swift, Socket.io, Skeleton

Summary: This project incorporates both an iOS application and full MEAN-stack website. The web interface includes log in, registration, and a dashboard where users (instructors) can create new quizzes or delete their existing ones. App users (students) are connected to the instructor's website via the Socket.io JavaScript library. When a quiz begins, the question is displayed on the student's app. When a quiz ends, the student is told if they selected the correct or incorrect answer, and the student responses are displayed as percentages on the web interface.
